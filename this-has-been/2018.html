	  <p>We got new Star Trek series this year. It was uneven. At times it didn't feel like Star Trek, but I enjoyed watching it. I love the ship design.</p>

	  <p>The sad thing is that Star Trek IP is in the hands of two different corporations. That's why the new series is legally required 
	  to be slightly different (so were the recent J.J. Abrams movies). How will the new show runners handle the return of picard?</p>

	  <p class="new-thought">And while we're talking about space: I'm happy I went to see The First Man in the cinema. 
	  The movie is worth seeing just for the opening sequence alone. Apparently a box office flop, but when I went to see it the cinema was packed and everyone was silent throughout.

	  <p class="new-thought">My favourite thing this year was a Halt and Catch Fire. I'm pretty much ready to watch it again. 
		  Great cast and screenplay. Even the subject matter - computers &amp; software were handled really well.

	  <p>I also got myself the two music albums associated with the movie. You can also find Spotify playlists curated by the show creators. I really dig the 
	  opening sequence and music.</p>

	  <p>I'm not the only one who <a href="http://www.seriouslytrivial.com/2016/10/15/amiga-continues-to-make-subtle-showings-on-halt-and-catch-fire/">noticed</a> the Amiga logo in one of the episodes.</p>

		  I did own an Amiga in the 90s. It was already on it's way out as one of the relevant players in personal computing. 
		  But it still refuses to die. I got myself an Amiga 1200 from ebay earlier this year. I had to replace the capacitors and pimped it out 
		  with a brand new case.

	  <p>I plan to do some programming on it if time permits.</p>
	  
	  <p class="new-thought">Sapiens is a fascinating book about us by Yuval Noah Harari.</p>
